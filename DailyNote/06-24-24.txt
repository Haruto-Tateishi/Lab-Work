-I studied multi-nominal distribution and Poisson distribution. Sometimes I saw Poisson distribution on the research papers.

-In terms of script, I realized that for some reason the position numbers on vcf file do not match that on the sequence file. I will ask Vitor how he dealt with it in Drosophila dataset. 

-The paper that I'm reading demonstrates what factor affects synonymous codon usage. They try to find relationship between Cc-content, recombination rate and expression patterns, It seems they found evidence saying the translational selection is not associated with SCU. I'll keep reading it.
