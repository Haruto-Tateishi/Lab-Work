-I made a few changes on the downsampling script and also make it print the situation when the file length becomes more than 29 which is the length I was stuck.

-I found that 1kG vcf file has some issues on the format. Some lines lack returning at the end of the line so that some lines have multiple position information. So, pysam could not read properly. At this point, I'm figuring out which vcf file has those problems and which does not, and it seems like the vcf of chr12 or less than that have the issue and chr13 or more than that do not have the issue.
